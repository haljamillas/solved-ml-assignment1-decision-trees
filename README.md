Assignment 1: Decision trees

<ol>

 <li>Build a decision tree by taking as input a maximum depth and by randomly splitting the dataset as 80/20 split i.e., 80% for training and 20% for testing. Provide the accuracy by averaging over 10 random 80/20 splits. Consider that particular tree which provides the best test accuracy as the desired one.</li>

 <li>What is the best possible depth limit to be used for your dataset. Provide a plot</li>

</ol>

explaining the same.

<ol start="3">

 <li>Perform the pruning operation over the tree obtained in question 2 using a valid</li>

</ol>

statistical test for comparison.

<ol start="4">

 <li>Print the final decision tree obtained from question 3 following the hierarchical levels of</li>

</ol>

data attributes as nodes of the tree.

<ol start="5">

 <li>A brief report explaining the procedure and the results</li>
